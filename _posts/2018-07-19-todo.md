title:  "TODO: GATs"

**G**eneric **A**ssociated **T**ypes (GATs for short) are a long awaited extension to Rust's type system. They allow working with higher kinded types (HKTs) making it possible to express certain useful things in the type system. A common example is the "streaming iterator" -- an iterator able to return items borrowing from `self` (the iterator itself). Unfortunately, GATs haven't even landed in nightly yet. So while we wait, we can try tackling the streaming iterator problem without GATs. In this post we explore three possible workarounds for problems like situations where an associated type depends on the lifetime of a `&self` receiver.

# The problem

Let's quickly recap the problem we're trying to solve. Let's take a look at [`std::io::Lines`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/struct.Lines.html): an iterator that can iterate over lines of a [`io::BufRead`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/io/trait.BufRead.html). It's very useful, but has a major problem: it returns `io::Result<String>`. This means that a new `String` object is allocated for every line, making the iterator pretty slow. This is a common pitfall and source of confusion (for example, see [this question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/45455275/2408867)).

## A better `io::Lines`

The better solution would be to manage a `String` buffer in the iterator and yielding `io::Result<&str>` as item. That way the allocated buffer is reused for all lines. So why doesn't `io::Lines` do that? Let's try it:

```rust
struct Lines<B: BufRead> {
    reader: B,
    buffer: String,
}

impl<B: BufRead> Iterator for Lines<B> {
    type Item = Result<&str>;
    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> { â€¦ }
}
```

Compiling this results in:

```
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
   |
10 |     type Item = Result<&str>;
   |                        ^ expected lifetime parameter
```

We can't just omit lifetime parameters, except in functions where lifetime elision kicks in. What lifetime do we need to specify? The lifetime of `&self`, as the `&str` is borrowed from the `String` in `Lines`. But this is not possible!

```rust
impl<B: BufRead> Iterator for Lines<B> {
    type Item = Result<&'s str>;
    fn next<'s>(&'s mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> { â€¦ }
}
```

this results in `undeclared lifetime` as the lifetime `'s` is only visible in the scope of the function definition.

With GATs, we can easily solve this problem (if we were to redefine the `Iterator` trait!):

```rust
trait IteratorGat {
    type Item<'s>;
    fn next<'s>(&'s mut self) -> Option<Self::Item<'s>>;
    // ^ or just remove lifetimes: lifetime elision is able to handle this
}

impl<B: BufRead> Iterator for Lines<B> {
    type Item<'s> = Result<&'s str>;
    fn next<'s>(&'s mut self) -> Option<Self::Item<'s>> { â€¦ }
}
```


## Another useful example: mutable windows of a slice

In the case of `io::Lines` we want to return a reference to memory inside the iterator. But using the `self` lifetime can be used in other situations as well, making it possible to safely express certain things. A good example is a `WindowsMut` iterator. Already today there exists [`slice::Windows`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/slice/struct.Windows.html) which is an iterator yielding windows to a slice. For example, `[1, 2, 3, 4].windows(2)` would yield the elements `&[1, 2]`, `&[2, 3]`, `&[3, 4]`.

Sometimes it would be useful to have a `WindowsMut`, yielding mutable sub slices of a slice. But this, again, is just not possible with the current iterator trait. The following simple example shows that we could easily break the world:

```rust
let mut slice = ['a', 'ðŸ’£', 'c'];
let mut it = slice.windows_mut(2);
let x = it.next().unwrap();
let y = it.next().unwrap();

// Oops, now we have two mutable references to the second element!
// (`&mut x[1]` and `&mut y[0]`)
```

The above example works because `x` is not borrowed from `it`, so `it` is not "locked" as mutably borrowed. Thus the compiler let's us happily call `next()` a second time. Fortunately, it's not possible to write such an `Iterator` implementation in safe Rust. Trying it always results in errors ([see on Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=ea50e340ee159d722aadaa1ed9695921&version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2015)).

## Not the solution we want: the crate `streaming-iterator`

[The crate `streaming-iterator`](https://crates.io/crates/streaming-iterator) works around this limitation by defining [another trait](https://docs.rs/streaming-iterator/0.1.4/streaming_iterator/trait.StreamingIterator.html):

```rust
pub trait StreamingIterator {
    type Item: ?Sized;
    fn advance(&mut self);
    fn get(&self) -> Option<&Self::Item>;
}
```

This main point to notice is that `Self::Item` is always returned by reference and not by value. This is certainly useful in some situations, but now the trait doesn't allow returning items by value which is also a limitation. Thus this solution requires two traits to work in all situations.

**In this post we are interested in solutions that only require one trait and where the impl can choose whether or not the `Item` borrows from `self`.** This will solve a range of other problems as well, instead of only the streaming iterator one.
