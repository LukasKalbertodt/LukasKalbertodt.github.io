title:  "Stories from my Early Years of Learning to Code"

It's pretty amusing to think back to my early years of learning how to code. I was around 12 years old when I wrote my first lines of HTML, batch (`.bat` files) and -- some time later -- C++. In this post I'll list some of my biggest misconception and moments of epiphany.

## Excel syntax is universal

Before doing "real programming", I learned a bit of Excel. There, you can calculate the content of a cell dynamically by using a formula. And that formula can even reference other cells. Wow!

If you would copy a formula from one cell to another, the cell-references in the formula would be updated. If you'd type `= A1 + B1` in the cell `C1` and then copy that formula into `C2`, it would change to `= A2 + B2`. Treating references as relative is useful most of the time. But sometimes you want absolute references, that never change. To make a cell-reference absolute, you have to use the dollar sign: `= $F$3`. This would always reference `F3`, no matter where the formula is copied.

Why am I telling you this? Well, back then I really liked the game ["lotrbfme2"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Battle_for_Middle-earth_II). And I wanted to see how it was created! So I browsed the game directory and finally opened a 1GB file with the appropriate file extension `.big`. Of course I used the most glorious text editor in existance: `notepad.exe`. After a brief loading period of only a few minutes, I finally could see the inner workings of the game!

I didn't understand a lot, but I saw some dollar signs. I was absolutely certain that those dollar signs denoted pixels that stayed the same color from one frame to another. I was amazed.

## Who needs a compiler when you have file extensions?

From Batch programming, I knew that I had to rename the text file I created from `foo.txt` to `foo.bat`. Then I could just double-click it and my program would run. Of course, my early Batch programs consistet entirely of infinite loops that would print something stupid.

But I wanted to create a game! So I somehow picked up the term "OpenGL" and read a few tutorials (without understanding anything basically). What all these tutorials lacked, in my opinion, was the information about what file extension I had to use. I tried `.opengl` or `.gl`, but double-clicking would never execute the colored-triangle example. That was fairly disappointing!

Even after learning that "OpenGL" is not a programming language and that those tutorials were written in C++, quite some time passed, before I realized that I might need dedicated programs to execute code written in languages like C++. I thought Windows XP could just run any code, if I just find the correct file extension.


## Generating variable names

After I've written my first tiny C++ programs I wanted to write a benchmark utility for my PC hardware. Idea: benchmark RAM by filling it up.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 100 * 1000 * 1000; i++) {
  int dummy = 3;
}
```

I thought that this would create 100 million `int` variables to fill up my RAM. But of course it doesn't. My explanation back then was that I just have one variable called `dummy` and to have many integers, all the variables must have different names. So I asked a friend, who knew a lot more about C++, how I would go about generating variable names. He had to explain a few things to me...

Interestingly, after getting used to the C++ way of doing things, PHP blew my mind a few years later. In PHP I could have a string and call a function with the name stored in the string:

```php
function foo($x) {
  echo $x;
}

$name = "foo";
$name(3);
```

At that point I realized that programming languages can be quite different, not only on the syntactic level.


## It's variables all the way

One of my biggest Eureka moments happened when I read a tutorial about creating a 2D space game.

It described how we use two integer variables to store the position of the player's spaceship on the screen. And in each loop iteration we would update these two integers. At some point it just made *click* in my head and I understood: everything is stored in variables! And programs just manipulate the variables' values over time!

This seems like an obvious thing to everyone who already knows how to code, but this insight felt amazing back then. Amazing enough that I still clearly remember that moments more than 10 years later.

I always try to remember all of those stories whenever I try to teach something about programming. Over the past couple of years, I taught to many hundreds of freshmen in the "introduction to programming" course at our university. Naturally, I needed to explain very basic things over and over again. But it never bothered me, because I know how my brain struggled to understand the same concepts back then. And what nonsense I believed to be true.

**And that's the beautiful part about teaching: witnessing your students having these moments of enlightenment.**
